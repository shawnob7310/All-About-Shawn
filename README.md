# Summary
Hello! I'm Shawn O'Brien a senior at [Brockton High School.](https://www.bpsma.org/schools/brockton-high-school) I am a student athlete but I do take my school work very seriously. I am currently in the search for a college that would fit me best and so far the top choices I have are [Stonehill](https://www.stonehill.edu/worth-more?gclid=Cj0KCQjwivbsBRDsARIsADyISJ8kuTSanCQnv2nCjZ0iooE8Z6WBdcTbi-iIwjy95F7blg5VY6fNfmsaAkL2EALw_wcB) and [WPI.](https://www.wpi.edu/) In college I want to study and pursue a career in computer science and computer engineering but im not quiet sure about which one just yet. I am thinking of these majors because computers and other technology has always fascinated me my whole life since I was young.
